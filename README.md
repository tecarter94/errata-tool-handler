# errata-tool-handler
A component of SBOMer NextGen that listens to advisories to invoke automatic SBOM generations from them, and to request generations for specific advisories

## Getting Started (Development) (WIP)

We can run the component locally through podman-compose, which will run the component with an ephemeral Kafka and Apicurio instance:

```shell script
bash ./hack/run-compose.sh
```

TODO: As the new components are implemented, they can be stood up in this podman-compose file using latest tagged images from Quay. This is so local deployment of the wider system can be possible for local development and testing purposes.

We can then invoke advisory generation manually with the request below:

```shell script
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"advisoryId": "1234"}' http://localhost:8080/v1/errata-tool/generate
```
